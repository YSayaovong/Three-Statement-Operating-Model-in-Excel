# Three-Statement Operating Model in Excel

This project demonstrates how to build a comprehensive three-statement operating model using Excel, integrating the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement for a complete view of financial health. In this project, I followed the guidance of Chris Reilly, a financial modeling expert, to create an operating model that includes various key components such as cash flow modeling, EBITDA schedules, forecasting, and financial ratio calculations.

## Key Learning and Tasks

- **Worksheet Formatting**: I reviewed and applied best practices for formatting Excel worksheets to create a clean, structured financial model.
  
- **Cash Flow Modeling**: I identified and structured the key components of cash flow in the model, ensuring that cash inflows and outflows are properly accounted for.
  
- **EBITDA Schedule**: I built the EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) schedule to accurately reflect the company’s operating performance.

- **Expense Classification**: I differentiated between various types of expenses, ensuring they were accurately classified and reflected in the financial statements.
  
- **Forecasting**: I learned how to forecast financials, applying terminology and steps necessary for projecting future income, balance sheet items, and cash flow.

- **Financial Ratio Calculations**: I calculated important financial ratios (e.g., liquidity, profitability, and solvency) to assess the company’s financial health and performance.

## Conclusion

Through this project, I gained practical experience in financial modeling, forecasting, and applying key financial metrics. This model is essential for understanding and analyzing a company’s overall financial performance and health.
